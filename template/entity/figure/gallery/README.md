# Figure/Gallery

## Definition

A Gallery is a collection of images grouped by a common conceptual/content purpose (i.e. to 
demonstrate a project portfolio, to showcase photographs documenting an event, to display available products in a product line). The gallery can be an interactive (javascript) component or not. 

## Usages

* Use only for a group of images that are related by purpose; Users assumptions will be that these images are related.
* If interactive gallery, player controls should be supported.
* Any optional captions should be marked up as a fig caption.


## Responsive Considerations

Image resizing will be an issue. 
For static gallery sets (displaying a collection of thumbnails) the re-configuration of
rows and columns will also be an issue.
