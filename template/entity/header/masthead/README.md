* Masthead for Journalistic/News sites often include details of the publication
* Masthead may include primary navigation elements such as: search, main nav, and audience or extra-site navigation

The branding elements of a masthead will often need to be minimized on smaller screens.
Transformations for any included primary navigation elements will also need to be considered due to limited screen space.
