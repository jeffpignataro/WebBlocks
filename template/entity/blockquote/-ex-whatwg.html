		<p>
			The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may
			contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our
			preferences do not determine what's true. We have a method, and that method helps us to reach not absolute
			truth, only asymptotic approaches to the truth — never there, just closer and closer, always finding vast new
			oceans of undiscovered possibilities. Cleverly designed experiments are the key.
