# 
# WebBlocks Build Configuration File
# 
# This file may be used to override the default WebBlocks build configuration.
# 
# A configuration property may be redefined as follows:
#
#   WebBlocks.config[:build][:dir] = 'build'
#
# This file may also reside elsewhere in your filesystem, in which case Rake 
# should be passed a command-line property on invocation:
#
#   rake [command] -- --config=Rakefile-config.rb
#
# A full list of configurable attributes and their default values may be found 
# in rake/config.rb.
#
